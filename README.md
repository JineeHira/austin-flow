### Data Engineering Project
In this project, the primary goal is to design and implement a robust system that handles data manipulation, storage, and scheduling seamlessly. 

The technology stack includes Python, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Apache Airflow, and Docker

**Project Workflow**
Data Extraction:
Python will be used to retrieve data from various sources, such as APIs, external databases, or files. The extracted data will be prepared for further processing.

**Data Transformation:**
Utilizing the power of Python, the extracted data will undergo transformation processes. This included data cleaning, normalization, and aggregation.

**Data Loading to PostgreSQL:**
The transformed data will be stored in the PostgreSQL database. SQLAlchemy will be used to create tables, define relationships, and perform database operations.

**Workflow Management with Apache Airflow:**
Apache Airflow will orchestrate the entire workflow. It will be responsible for scheduling the data processing tasks, monitoring their execution, and handling any failures or retries.

**Daily Automation:**
The workflow will be scheduled to run daily, ensuring that data is processed and stored consistently. Apache Airflow's scheduler will manage the execution of tasks at specified intervals.
